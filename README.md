# ASPICE ASSSESMENT TOOL

## Introduction

This tool is based on the PAM (http://www.automotivespice.com/fileadmin/software-download/AutomotiveSPICE_PAM_31.pdf) and shall aid an ASPICE Assesor to perform his Assesment. The Questions and statements present in this tool are not authorative and it is the responsibility of the assesor to change them as needed and he sees fit. There is no warantee that the questions or processes are complete.

Note the Tool avoids to descope Questions (N/A shall not be used), but one can Descope a Process from the questionaire presented to a team. A Process not assessed shall be show as not rated.

The Team setup, questions and results are stored in plain files in a git repository. The idea is that each project can maintain it's git repository and several assesors can work in parallel. 

The Report view can produce a MarkDown report, which can show the assesment results over time and can guide the Team and Management where further improvement is needed.

## Extension

It is planned to also extend this tool to help assesment of general processes according to ISO9001 and ISO26262. 


## License and Copy Right

The tool has been written in the spare time of the author, with the help of the relevant standards. The Processes and Best Practices are not necessarily a verbose copy of the standard. The respective standard is the only valid source of truth.

The tool and it is contents are licensed under the GPL. I would like to highlight that the tool shall not be sold - as this is prohibited by the GPL and the PAM which was part of the input.
